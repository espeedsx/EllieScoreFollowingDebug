# Score Following Algorithm Failure Analysis

## Context
You are analyzing a failure in a real-time score following algorithm that uses dynamic programming to match musical performance notes against a musical score. The algorithm maintains a matrix where rows represent score events and columns represent performance events.

## Failure Details
- **Failure Type**: score_drop
- **Time**: 4.924 seconds
- **Pitch**: 62 (MIDI note number)
- **Expected**: Maintain score around 6.0
- **Actual**: Score dropped to 2.0

## Algorithm Context
The dynamic programming algorithm uses these key components:
- **Vertical Rule**: Advance in score without matching (penalty for missing notes)
- **Horizontal Rule**: Match performance note to score note (credit for matches)
- **Final Value**: Maximum of vertical and horizontal rule values
- **Used Pitches**: Notes already matched in current chord
- **Unused Count**: Number of expected notes not yet matched

## Decision Sequence Leading to Failure
Decision 1: Row 12, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 14.0
  - Horizontal rule: 9.0
  - Final value: 14.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 2: Row 13, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 12.0
  - Horizontal rule: 7.0
  - Final value: 12.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 3: Row 14, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 10.0
  - Horizontal rule: 5.0
  - Final value: 10.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 4: Row 15, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 8.0
  - Horizontal rule: 3.0
  - Final value: 8.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 5: Row 16, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 6.0
  - Horizontal rule: 1.0
  - Final value: 6.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 2

Decision 6: Row 17, Pitch 62, Time 4.924s
  - Vertical rule: 2.0
  - Horizontal rule: -281474976710653.0
  - Final value: 2.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

## Score Progression
The algorithm's confidence scores leading to the failure:
14.0 -> 12.0 -> 10.0 -> 8.0 -> 6.0 -> 2.0
Trend: decreasing (from 14.0 to 2.0)

## Timing Analysis
- Decision span: 0.000 seconds
- Average inter-onset interval: 0.000s
- Maximum gap: 0.000s
- Time to failure: 0.000s

## Preceding Successful Matches
Match 1: Pitch 65 at 3.527s, Score 12.0
Match 2: Pitch 64 at 3.663s, Score 14.0
Match 3: Pitch 69 at 4.289s, Score 16.0

## Your Task
Analyze this failure and provide insights on:

1. **Root Cause**: What specific algorithm decision or parameter likely caused this failure?

2. **Decision Tree Analysis**: How did the sequence of decisions lead to the wrong outcome?

3. **Parameter Issues**: Which algorithm parameters (timing windows, scoring weights, penalties) might need adjustment?

4. **Timing Constraints**: Are the timing constraints too strict or too loose for this scenario?

5. **Alternative Strategies**: What alternative algorithmic approaches might handle this case better?

6. **Fix Recommendations**: Specific, actionable changes to prevent this type of failure.

Please be specific and reference the exact decision points and values shown in the context.
