# Score Following Algorithm Failure Analysis

## Context
You are analyzing a failure in a real-time score following algorithm that uses dynamic programming to match musical performance notes against a musical score. The algorithm maintains a matrix where rows represent score events and columns represent performance events.

## Failure Details
- **Failure Type**: no_match
- **Time**: 57.667 seconds
- **Pitch**: 68 (MIDI note number)
- **Expected**: Match for pitch 68 at time 57.667
- **Actual**: No match found

## Algorithm Context
The dynamic programming algorithm uses these key components:
- **Vertical Rule**: Advance in score without matching (penalty for missing notes)
- **Horizontal Rule**: Match performance note to score note (credit for matches)
- **Final Value**: Maximum of vertical and horizontal rule values
- **Used Pitches**: Notes already matched in current chord
- **Unused Count**: Number of expected notes not yet matched

## Decision Sequence Leading to Failure
Decision 1: Row 178, Pitch 68, Time 57.667s
  - Vertical rule: 565.0
  - Horizontal rule: 560.0
  - Final value: 565.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 2: Row 179, Pitch 68, Time 57.667s
  - Vertical rule: 563.0
  - Horizontal rule: 558.0
  - Final value: 563.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 4

Decision 3: Row 180, Pitch 68, Time 57.667s
  - Vertical rule: 555.0
  - Horizontal rule: 553.0
  - Final value: 555.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 2

Decision 4: Row 181, Pitch 68, Time 57.667s
  - Vertical rule: 551.0
  - Horizontal rule: 546.0
  - Final value: 551.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 3

Decision 5: Row 182, Pitch 68, Time 57.667s
  - Vertical rule: 545.0
  - Horizontal rule: -281474976710653.0
  - Final value: 545.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

## Score Progression
The algorithm's confidence scores leading to the failure:
565.0 -> 563.0 -> 555.0 -> 551.0 -> 545.0
Trend: decreasing (from 565.0 to 545.0)

## Timing Analysis
- Decision span: 0.000 seconds
- Average inter-onset interval: 0.000s
- Maximum gap: 0.000s
- Time to failure: 0.000s

## Preceding Successful Matches
Match 1: Pitch 64 at 57.077s, Score 573.0
Match 2: Pitch 48 at 57.079s, Score 575.0
Match 3: Pitch 66 at 57.402s, Score 577.0

## Your Task
Analyze this failure and provide insights on:

1. **Root Cause**: What specific algorithm decision or parameter likely caused this failure?

2. **Decision Tree Analysis**: How did the sequence of decisions lead to the wrong outcome?

3. **Parameter Issues**: Which algorithm parameters (timing windows, scoring weights, penalties) might need adjustment?

4. **Timing Constraints**: Are the timing constraints too strict or too loose for this scenario?

5. **Alternative Strategies**: What alternative algorithmic approaches might handle this case better?

6. **Fix Recommendations**: Specific, actionable changes to prevent this type of failure.

Please be specific and reference the exact decision points and values shown in the context.
