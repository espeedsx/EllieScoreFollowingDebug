# Score Following Algorithm Failure Analysis

## Context
You are analyzing a failure in a real-time score following algorithm that uses dynamic programming to match musical performance notes against a musical score. The algorithm maintains a matrix where rows represent score events and columns represent performance events.

## Failure Details
- **Failure Type**: no_match
- **Time**: 28.307 seconds
- **Pitch**: 67 (MIDI note number)
- **Expected**: Match for pitch 67 at time 28.307
- **Actual**: No match found

## Algorithm Context
The dynamic programming algorithm uses these key components:
- **Vertical Rule**: Advance in score without matching (penalty for missing notes)
- **Horizontal Rule**: Match performance note to score note (credit for matches)
- **Final Value**: Maximum of vertical and horizontal rule values
- **Used Pitches**: Notes already matched in current chord
- **Unused Count**: Number of expected notes not yet matched

## Decision Sequence Leading to Failure
Decision 1: Row 83, Pitch 67, Time 28.307s
  - Vertical rule: 241.0
  - Horizontal rule: 241.0
  - Final value: 241.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 2: Row 84, Pitch 67, Time 28.307s
  - Vertical rule: 239.0
  - Horizontal rule: 239.0
  - Final value: 239.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 2

Decision 3: Row 85, Pitch 67, Time 28.307s
  - Vertical rule: 235.0
  - Horizontal rule: 235.0
  - Final value: 235.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

Decision 4: Row 86, Pitch 67, Time 28.307s
  - Vertical rule: 233.0
  - Horizontal rule: 233.0
  - Final value: 233.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 2

Decision 5: Row 87, Pitch 67, Time 28.307s
  - Vertical rule: 229.0
  - Horizontal rule: 229.0
  - Final value: 229.0
  - Match flag: False
  - Used pitches: []
  - Unused count: 1

## Score Progression
The algorithm's confidence scores leading to the failure:
241.0 -> 239.0 -> 235.0 -> 233.0 -> 229.0
Trend: decreasing (from 241.0 to 229.0)

## Timing Analysis
- Decision span: 0.000 seconds
- Average inter-onset interval: 0.000s
- Maximum gap: 0.000s
- Time to failure: 0.000s

## Preceding Successful Matches
Match 1: Pitch 71 at 28.194s, Score 248.0
Match 2: Pitch 62 at 28.212s, Score 250.0
Match 3: Pitch 67 at 28.212s, Score 252.0

## Your Task
Analyze this failure and provide insights on:

1. **Root Cause**: What specific algorithm decision or parameter likely caused this failure?

2. **Decision Tree Analysis**: How did the sequence of decisions lead to the wrong outcome?

3. **Parameter Issues**: Which algorithm parameters (timing windows, scoring weights, penalties) might need adjustment?

4. **Timing Constraints**: Are the timing constraints too strict or too loose for this scenario?

5. **Alternative Strategies**: What alternative algorithmic approaches might handle this case better?

6. **Fix Recommendations**: Specific, actionable changes to prevent this type of failure.

Please be specific and reference the exact decision points and values shown in the context.
